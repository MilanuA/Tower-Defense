# Disclaimer: 
This project is a prototype created as part of my journey to learn Unreal Engine 5. It is not fully balanced and features only a single level. Please keep in mind that this is an early-stage **learning project** and not a finalized game.

# Important Note:
As of **December 5, 2024**, I am currently unable to build the game. Due to issues with materials during the build process, I recommend running the project in the Unreal Engine editor, preferably version 5.4.4. Apologies for the inconvenience caused.
